## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues by opening a draft security advisory or by emailing the maintainers at `security@example.com`.  Include the following information to help us triage quickly:

* A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
* Steps to reproduce the issue, preferably with a minimal proof-of-concept.
* The environment in which the vulnerability was observed.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within two business days.  After investigating we will coordinate a disclosure timeline with you and release patches as quickly as possible.
